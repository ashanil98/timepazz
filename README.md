Coders just want to have fun!

I am a semi-noob, semi-experienced coder here. I am on GitHub no thanks to my pro coder friends. Hope I'll catch up. 
Never gonna give myself up, and let myself down. Never gonna run around and desert this. Never gonna make me cry and say goodbye. Never tell a lie and hurt myself.
